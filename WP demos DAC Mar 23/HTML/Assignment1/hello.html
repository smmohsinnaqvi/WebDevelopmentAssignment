    Object-Oriented Programming
    Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language
    Difference between Object-oriented and Object-based programming language.
    In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.

    Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.
    
    Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.
    
    The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.
    
    The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
    
    OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
    Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
    
    Object
    Class
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation
    Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:
    
    Coupling
    Cohesion
    Association
    Aggregation
    Composition
    Java OOPs Concepts 
    Object
    Java Object
    Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.
    
    An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.
    
    Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.
    
    Class
    Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
    
    A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.
    
    
    Inheritance
    When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
    
    Polymorphism in Java
    Polymorphism
    If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.
    
    In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
    
    Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.
    
    Abstraction
    Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
    
    
    In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
    
    Encapsulation in Java OOPs Concepts
    Encapsulation
    Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
    
    A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.
    
    Coupling
    Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.
    
    Cohesion
    Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.
    
    Association
    Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:
    
    One to One
    One to Many
    Many to One, and
    Many to Many
    Let's understand the relationship with real-time examples. For example, One country can have one prime minister (one to one), and a prime minister can have many ministers (one to many). Also, many MP's can have one prime minister (many to one), and many ministers can have many departments (many to many).
    
    Association can be undirectional or bidirectional.
    
    Aggregation
    Aggregation is a way to achieve Association. Aggregation represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. It represents the weak relationship between objects. It is also termed as a has-a relationship in Java. Like, inheritance represents the is-a relationship. It is another way to reuse objects.
    
    Composition
    The composition is also a way to achieve Association. The composition represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object. It is the state where containing objects do not have an independent existence. If you delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted automatically.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; ">Use Of Interface</h1>
    <p>An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behaviour. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.

        The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
        
        When we decide a type of entity by its behaviour and not via attribute we should define it as an interface.
        
        Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract (only method signature, no body). 
        
        Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the behaviour.
        Interface do not have constructor. 
        Represent behaviour as interface unless every sub-type of the class is guarantee to have that behaviour. 
        An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an interface and any class implementing Player must be able to (or must implement) move(). So it specifies a set of methods that the class has to implement.
        If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then the class must be declared abstract.
        A Java library example is Comparator Interface. If a class implements this interface, then it can be used to sort a collection.
        Syntax:
        
        interface {
        
            // declare constant fields
            // declare methods that abstract 
            // by default.   
        }
        To declare an interface, use the interface keyword. It is used to provide total abstraction. That means all the methods in an interface are declared with an empty body and are public and all fields are public, static, and final by default. A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface. To implement interface use implements keyword.
        
        Why do we use an Interface?
        It is used to achieve total abstraction.
        Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.
        Any class can extend only 1 class but can any class implement infinite number of interface.
        It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
        Interfaces are used to implement abstraction. So the question arises why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?
        The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in the interface are final, public and static.
        
        // A simple interface
        
        interface Player
        {
            final int id = 10;
            int move();
        }</p>

        <a id ="Use Of InstanceOf"></a><br/>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; ">Use of instance operator</h1>


        <p> 
            If we apply instanceof operator with a variable that have null value, it returns false. Let's see the example given below where we apply instanceof operator with the variable that have null value.
            
            class Dog2{  
             public static void main(String args[]){  
              Dog2 d=null;  
              System.out.println(d instanceof Dog2);//false  
             }  
            }  
            Test it Now
            Output:false
            Downcasting with java instanceof operator
            When Subclass type refers to the object of Parent class, it is known as downcasting. If we perform it directly, compiler gives Compilation error. If you perform it by typecasting, ClassCastException is thrown at runtime. But if we use instanceof operator, downcasting is possible.
            
            Dog d=new Animal();//Compilation error  
            If we perform downcasting by typecasting, ClassCastException is thrown at runtime.
            
            Dog d=(Dog)new Animal();  
            //Compiles successfully but ClassCastException is thrown at runtime  
            Possibility of downcasting with instanceof
            Let's see the example, where downcasting is possible by instanceof operator.
            
            class Animal { }  
              
            class Dog3 extends Animal {  
              static void method(Animal a) {  
                if(a instanceof Dog3){  
                   Dog3 d=(Dog3)a;//downcasting  
                   System.out.println("ok downcasting performed");  
                }  
              }  
               
              public static void main (String [] args) {  
                Animal a=new Dog3();  
                Dog3.method(a);  
              } 
            }
                </p>
                <a id ="Exception Handling"></a><br/>
                <h1 style="text-align: center; ">Exception Handling</h1>
            <p>Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
                1) Checked Exception
                The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions. For example, IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
                
                2) Unchecked Exception
                The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.
                
                3) Error
                Error is irrecoverable. Some example of errors are OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.
                
                
                Java Exception Keywords
                Java provides five keywords that are used to handle the exception. The following table describes each.
                
                Keyword	Description
                try	The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally.
                catch	The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block later.
                finally	The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
                throw	The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
                throws	The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. It doesn't throw an exception. It is always used with method signature.
                Java Exception Handling Example
                Let's see an example of Java Exception Handling in which we are using a try-catch statement to handle the exception.
                
                JavaExceptionExample.java
                
                public class JavaExceptionExample{  
                  public static void main(String args[]){  
                   try{  
                      //code that may raise exception  
                      int data=100/0;  
                   }catch(ArithmeticException e){System.out.println(e);}  
                   //rest code of the program   
                   System.out.println("rest of the code...");  
                  }  
                }  </p>
