    <h3 id="oops" style="color:aquamarine;"> OOPS Concepts</h3>
    <img src="Java.png" alt="java" height="200px" width="100%">
    <p>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides
        many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.

        Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything
        is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.

        Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.

        The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.

        The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes,
        abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

        OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
        Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming
        is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development
        and maintenance by providing some concepts:

        Object
        Class
        Inheritance
        Polymorphism
        Abstraction
        Encapsulation
        Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

        Coupling
        Cohesion
        Association
        Aggregation
        Composition

    <h3 id="interfaces" style="color: aquamarine;">Interfaces in Java</h3>
    <p>
        An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a
        class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behaviour. A Java interface contains static constants and
        abstract methods.

        The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java
        interface, not the method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In other
        words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. Java
        Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.

        When we decide a type of entity by its behaviour and not via attribute we should define it as an interface.

        Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by
        default abstract (only method signature, no body).

    <h3 id="instanceof" style="color: aquamarine;">InstanceOf Operator in Java</h3>
    <p>The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or
        subclass or interface).

        The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It
        returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it
        returns false.

        Simple example of java instanceof
        Let's see the simple example of instance operator where it tests the current class.

        class Simple1{
        public static void main(String args[]){
        Simple1 s=new Simple1();
        System.out.println(s instanceof Simple1);//true
        }
        }
        Test it Now
        Output:true
        An object of subclass type is also a type of parent class. For example, if Dog extends Animal then object of Dog
        can be referred by either Dog or Animal class.

    <h3 id="exception" style="color: aquamarine;">Exception Handling</h3>
    <p>
        The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal
        flow of the application can be maintained.

        In this tutorial, we will learn about Java exceptions, it's types, and the difference between checked and
        unchecked exceptions.

        What is Exception in Java?
        Dictionary Meaning: Exception is an abnormal condition.

        In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown
        at runtime.

        What is Exception Handling?
        Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException,
        SQLException, RemoteException, etc.


        Advantage of Exception Handling
        The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. An exception
        normally disrupts the normal flow of the application; that is why we need to handle exceptions. Let's consider a
        scenario:
